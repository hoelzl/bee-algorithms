(defn bee-action
  "Selects the action performed by a bee at each simulation step.

  The action for each step depends on the previous action: if the bee
  was previously heating or cooling and the current temperature does
  not indicate that this should stop (i.e., if it is below
  stop-cooling or above stop-heating) we continue with the previous
  action.  This implements a simple kind of hysterisis, except when
  the start and stop temperatures are equal.  If the bee was
  previously doing nothing and the temperature is above start-cooling
  the bee starts heating, if the temperature is below start-heating it
  starts heating.  Otherwise it continues to do nothing.

  Note that if (<= start-cooling temperature start-heating) the bee
  prefers cooling over heating; for bees created with make-bees such a
  specification can only happen when
